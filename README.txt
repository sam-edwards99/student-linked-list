## Usage:
  The code is compiled with 'gcc main.c -o main'
  (I actually compiled it using CMakeLists, a makefile equivalent used in CLION IDE. So the above should work, although I am not positive)
  
  The code is executed with './main'
  
  Execution brings up a cmd line prompt with various options for using the program.

## Current Status:

   The code reads in the datafile correctly, but it does not update the datafile.
   
   The code can add in new records correctly.
   
   The code is able to unreliably perform update, read, delete, etc.
